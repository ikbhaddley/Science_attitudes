There are two seperate scripts, the recoding script and the analysis script called

The recoding script "survey_data_recoded_mine_fullneg.R" converts the 
origional survey spreadsheet "Public Voice - Genetics Society 311022.sav"
this created the input for the analysis : "survey_data_recoded_mine_fullneg.cvs" 

The analysis script is called "grandscript_fullmodel_december.R"

The scipts will improtant packages needed if your computer does not already have them.
Some systems may require appropriate permissions to do this.
Scripts were run on R version 4.2.2 .


There are also two supplementary scripts, these isolate the very negative populations, 
but otherwise the scripts are identical although output tables are renamed. 
The input data is the same : "Public Voice - Genetics Society 311022.sav"
The recoding script is: "survey_data_recoded_mine_veryneg.R"
The recoding output is: "survey_data_recoded_mine_fullneg.csv"
The analysis script is: "grandscript_fullneg2.R"

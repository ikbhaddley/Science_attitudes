READ ME;

There are two seperate scripts, recoding_script and the analysis script called grand_script

The recoding script converts the origional survey spreadsheet "Public Voice - Genetics Society 311022.sav"
this created the input for the analysis : "survey_data_recoded_mine_fullneg.csv" 

The scipts will improtant packages needed if your computer does not already have them. Some systems may require appropriate permissions to do this.
Scripts were run on R version 4.2.1.


There are also two supplementary scripts, these isolate the very negative populations, 
but otherwise the scripts are identical although output tables are renamed. 
The input data is: "Public Voice - Genetics Society 311022.sav"
The recoding script is: "survey_data_recoded_mine_2.csv"
The analysis script is: "grandscript_fullneg2.R"
